Use rotating lines to make art

### TODO
[] Create board as component to translate between editor and viewer
[] Use page store to subscribe and determine weather the header should show, hide on homepage
        In hindsight, maybe handle it with CSS
        But will it be possible if the page is a slot next to the nav
[] Dotted lines
[] Select and rotating squares
[] Finding optimal format for saving and importing
